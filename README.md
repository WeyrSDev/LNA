another C++/Lua binding

Heavily inspired by Selene (github.com/jeremyong/selene).

Main difference is that I'm starting off trying to cross the bridge between 
std containers and Lua tables. We'll see how that goes. Containers of primitive
types work right now, but I haven't tackled functions or userdata at all yet.
